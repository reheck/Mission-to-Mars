# Mission-to-Mars
###The Mission to Mars' web app is looking good and functioning well, but I want to add more polish to it. Adjust the current web app to include all four of the Mars hemisphere images. To do this, I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images. Additional styling as added to the web app to add interest to the display.
